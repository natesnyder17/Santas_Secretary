Brief Summary:
    - This project is meant to be a companion app to help people for christmas shopping. This includes which places offer the most discounts and when, what kids have been asking for recently (needs a keyword like Lego, Game, or Plushie), and what type of Christmas tree is most popular and it's average price. 
    - I used 5 databases (Christmas Sales and Trends, Christmas Tree Sales Data, and Letters to Santa: Analyzing Kids Christmas Wishes, Naughty Or Nice List, and Christmas Quotes)

Planned Features:
    - Most Popular Christmas Tree and average prices for each type.
    - What date before christmas offers the best sales (Black Friday, Christmas Market, etc).
    - Given a key word what type of products did other kids ask for. (Given a word like Lego it can output back what lego sets other kids asked for)
    - Is the product your looking at online or available to ship.
