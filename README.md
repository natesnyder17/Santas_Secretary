Brief Summary:
    - This project is meant to be a companion app to help people for christmas shopping. This includes a customizable christmas wishlist, what kids have been asking for recently (needs a keyword like Lego, Game, or Plushie), and what type of Christmas tree is most popular and it's average price. Also includes some data bases for fun like the naughty or nice list and the christmas quotes database these are used in conjunction with the others to make the application more christmas themed. The main point is to use 
    - I used 5 databases (Christmas Sales and Trends, Christmas Tree Sales Data, Naughty Or Nice List, and Christmas Quotes)

What this App can do 
- Create Accounts that can be logged into and modified. 
- Create multiple wishlist with multiple items each. When a new item is inserted a price can be estimated from data sets. Wishlist items can also be moved from the wishlist to the shopping list
- Create Shopping list with multiple items. There is a price reccomendation when items are entered thjey also can be marked or just removed if they are purchased. You can also view the total estimated cost of the list. Finally theres an Audit log showing every item added or deleted.
- Uses a public datset to determine if a user is naughty or nice.
-  Has a christmas Tree finder which can reccomend the cheapest or most popular tree while showing the average proce. Theres also and option to add said tree to a users shopping list.
-  Uses a christmas quotes public dataset to give christmas quotes whenever the user opens the app
